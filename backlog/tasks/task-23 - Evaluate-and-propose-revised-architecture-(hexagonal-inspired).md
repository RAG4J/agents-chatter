## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Revisit the current backend/frontend architecture and identify a modular approach that supports future growth.

Scope:
- Assess existing Spring-based backend structure (web-app, event-bus, agents) and identify coupling/pain points that hinder modularity.
- Explore suitability of hexagonal (ports & adapters) or similar architectures for the project, considering messaging, agent orchestration, and frontend integration.
- Produce an architecture proposal outlining recommended modules, boundaries, interfaces, and migration steps, ensuring alignment with current capabilities and future roadmap.

Out of scope: implementing the new architecture; this task focuses on analysis and design recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Deliverable includes a written architecture proposal comparing current state vs. recommended modular/hexagonal approach.
- [ ] #2 Proposal identifies key domain boundaries, adapter layers, and integration points aligned with existing features.
- [ ] #3 Document outlines phased migration steps or prerequisites to adopt the new architecture without disrupting active development.
