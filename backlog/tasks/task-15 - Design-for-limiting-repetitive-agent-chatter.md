## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a solution design that prevents agents from repeatedly reacting to one another without adding new information. Consider mechanisms such as topic threading with reply depth limits and a moderator agent that filters low-value responses. The document should explain the selected approach, how it integrates with the existing system, and enumerate follow-up implementation work.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Design evaluates at least two mitigation strategies and selects a preferred option.
- [ ] #2 Document explains how the chosen approach fits into the current message flow and architecture.
- [ ] #3 Deliverable lists specific follow-up engineering tasks derived from the design.
