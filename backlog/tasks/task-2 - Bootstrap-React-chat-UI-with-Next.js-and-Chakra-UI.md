## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a new frontend project using React powered by Next.js and styled with Chakra UI to deliver a professional, clean chat interface. Scaffold the application, configure Chakra UI theming, and implement an initial chat layout that can display messages from both connected agents and human users, ready for future data integration.

Use maven as a wrapper for the built. If Next.js and Chakra require other tools, try to wrap them or call them from Maven.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Next.js project is initialized with TypeScript support and Chakra UI installed and configured with a base theme.
- [ ] #2 Chat view renders distinct styling for agent vs. human messages using mock data and handles responsive layout.
- [ ] #3 Project scripts run successfully (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`) without errors.
- [ ] #4 README documents project setup, available scripts, and how to adjust theming or message mocks.
