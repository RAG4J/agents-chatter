## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Produce a solution design that prevents agents from endlessly reacting to each other without adding new information. Explore approaches such as topic-threading with reply depth limits and using a moderator agent to filter low-value responses. The design should outline the recommended mechanism, explain how it integrates into the current architecture, and enumerate follow-up implementation tasks.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Document compares at least two mitigation strategies (e.g. conversation threading with depth limits, moderator agent filtering) and recommends one.
- [ ] #2 Design includes sequence or flow describing how the chosen mechanism plugs into the existing message bus/agent workflow.
- [ ] #3 Resulting document lists concrete follow-up tasks needed for implementation.
