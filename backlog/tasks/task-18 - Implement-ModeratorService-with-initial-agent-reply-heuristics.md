## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a `ModeratorService` that evaluates candidate agent messages using rule-based heuristics before they are published.

Scope:
- Provide an approval API (e.g., `evaluate(agentName, messageContext) -> decision`) supporting APPROVE/REJECT (and optional EDIT) outcomes.
- Implement baseline heuristics: duplicate payload suppression, per-agent cooldown windows, and repeated agent pair loop detection.
- Emit rationale metrics/logs/events when rejections occur to support transparency requirements.
- Introduce an `AgentPublisher` facade for agents to submit replies through the moderator instead of calling `MessageService` directly.

Out of scope: advanced semantic analysis or ML scoring.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 ModeratorService decisions are enforced for all automated agent publications via the new AgentPublisher facade.
- [ ] #2 At least three heuristics (duplicate payload, cooldown, agent pair loop) are implemented and unit-tested.
- [ ] #3 Moderation rejections produce structured logs or events containing the suppressed reason.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
Implementation Plan:
1. Define moderation contracts
   - Introduce `ModeratorService` interface with an `evaluate(agentName, messageContext)` method returning APPROVE/REJECT (plus optional metadata).
   - Create a `ModerationDecision` model capturing status, rationale, and any transformed payload.
   - Outline a `AgentMessageContext` record carrying payload, thread metadata, agent depth, and previous history references.
2. Implement rule engine scaffolding
   - Provide baseline rule implementations for duplicate payload blocking, per-agent cooldown windows, and reciprocal agent loop detection.
   - Add configuration properties controlling cooldown duration, duplicate matching strategy (exact vs. case-insensitive), and loop detection window size.
   - Compose rules inside `ModeratorService` (e.g., ordered list or predicate chain) and short-circuit on the first rejection.
3. Integrate with ConversationCoordinator
   - Extend the coordinator to call `ModeratorService` after depth checks but before publishing.
   - Ensure accepted decisions can optionally mutate payload, while rejections log rationale and prevent publication.
   - Wire moderator into `AgentPublisher` so all agent submissions flow through the combined depth + rule checks.
4. Persistence / state tracking
   - Store recent agent messages per thread to support duplicate/loop detection; leverage existing coordinator thread state or introduce a lightweight cache with eviction.
   - Track per-agent last sent timestamps for cooldown enforcement (use `ConcurrentHashMap` with `Instant` values and configurable expiry).
5. Testing and observability
   - Add unit tests covering each heuristic and the overall decision pipeline (approve/reject cases, payload edits if supported).
   - Update existing agent tests (Echo, placeholder) to ensure moderator interaction is mocked/stubbed when needed; add new tests verifying blocked responses donâ€™t reach the bus.
   - Emit structured logs/metrics on moderation outcomes for future telemetry surfaces (to be consumed by task-20).
