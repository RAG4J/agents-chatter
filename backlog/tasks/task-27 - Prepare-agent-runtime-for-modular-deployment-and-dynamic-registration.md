## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Lay the groundwork for running agents as separate processes or modules that can register themselves with the core platform.

Scope:
- Define agent-facing ports (e.g., `AgentRegistrationPort`, `AgentMessagingPort`) and establish contracts for subscription, publishing, and moderation callbacks.
- Design a lightweight registry/service that tracks active agents, allowing dynamic discovery and configuration (in-memory for now, ready for external implementations later).
- Explore protocols (REST, gRPC, message bus topics) that remote agents could use to register and communicate; document the recommended approach.

Out of scope: full implementation of remote agent processes or network security; focus on interfaces, registry, and documentation so future tasks can plug in separate runtimes.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Agent registration and messaging ports are defined and integrated into the application layer.
- [ ] #2 A registry or service manages agent lifecycle events (register/unregister) and is consumed by existing agents.
- [ ] #3 Documentation outlines how external agents would integrate using the defined ports and communication protocol.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
Implementation Plan:
1. Define agent-facing ports and events
   - Specify inbound ports for agent registration/deregistration and outbound ports for messaging callbacks.
   - Clarify what metadata an agent must provide (capabilities, transport info) and document the expected contract.
2. Implement in-memory agent registry adapter
   - Build a simple adapter/service in the web-app that stores registered agents and exposes discovery APIs.
   - Ensure thread-safe operations and provide hooks for integration with the messaging pipeline.
3. Update agent orchestration flow
   - Modify existing agent startup/shutdown to register/deregister via the new ports rather than static wiring.
   - Prepare hooks for external agents: design REST/HTTP endpoints or message topics they can use to register.
4. Document extension pattern
   - Produce a guide describing how to run agents out-of-process: required API calls, expected message contracts, and initialization steps.
5. Verification
   - Write unit tests for the registry to confirm dynamic registration works.
   - Execute smoke tests with the in-memory registry to ensure agents continue to function.
