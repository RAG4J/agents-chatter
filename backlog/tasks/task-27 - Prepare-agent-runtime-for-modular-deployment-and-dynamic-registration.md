## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Lay the groundwork for running agents as separate processes or modules that can register themselves with the core platform.

Scope:
- Define agent-facing ports (e.g., `AgentRegistrationPort`, `AgentMessagingPort`) and establish contracts for subscription, publishing, and moderation callbacks.
- Design a lightweight registry/service that tracks active agents, allowing dynamic discovery and configuration (in-memory for now, ready for external implementations later).
- Explore protocols (REST, gRPC, message bus topics) that remote agents could use to register and communicate; document the recommended approach.

Out of scope: full implementation of remote agent processes or network security; focus on interfaces, registry, and documentation so future tasks can plug in separate runtimes.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Agent registration and messaging ports are defined and integrated into the application layer.
- [ ] #2 A registry or service manages agent lifecycle events (register/unregister) and is consumed by existing agents.
- [ ] #3 Documentation outlines how external agents would integrate using the defined ports and communication protocol.
